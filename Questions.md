    - Historical Evolution and Game Entrenchment
    - Motivation: To determine whether traditional powers (e.g., Russia, Europe) still dominate due to historical momentum, or if emerging markets (e.g., India, China) are growing faster, signaling a shift in the game's geopolitical balance.
2. Question: How has the demographic composition of the global ranking changed in recent years?
    - Demographics and Gender Gap Analysis
    - Motivation: To verify if the game is becoming socially more inclusive or if it remains structurally dominated by specific demographic groups.

### 2. Focusing on Subsets

1. Question: What is the relationship between match frequency and title acquisition for the best players of each continent?
    - Career Velocity and Strategies
    - Motivation: To discover whether incessant play is more effective than strategic pauses for study, and if different training cultures exist between Asia, Europe, and the Americas.

    - U20 Scouting
    - Motivation: To identify future world champions before they reach the peak (talent scouting) and evaluate the future "health" of national federations for the coming decade.
3. Question: How does the volume of games played vary across different life stages of a Top Player? Is there a specific "intensity threshold" at some specifi age to became a champion?
    - Workload Analysis and Career Intensity

1. Question: What is the difference in ranking mobility between Low-Rating players and Top Players?
    - Rating Mobility High vs. Low ELO
    - Motivation: To demonstrate the structural nature of the ranking system: the ease of climbing positions from the bottom versus the extreme difficulty of maintaining a position at the top.
2. Question: Is there a correlation between the average age of a nation's players and its average competitive strength?
    - Generational Clash (Youth vs. Experience)
    - Motivation: To verify if the advent of modern training methods chess engines, online databases disproportionately favors nations with a lower average age compared to those relying on traditional experience.
