The two questions that i will use for the project will be: 
1) Question: How has the demographic composition of the global ranking changed in recent years?
    - Demographics and Gender Gap Analysis
    - Motivation: To verify if the game is becoming socially more inclusive or if it remains structurally dominated by specific demographic groups.
2) Question: Is there a correlation between the average age of a nation's players and its average competitive strength?
   - Generational Clash (Youth vs. Experience)
   - Motivation: To verify if the advent of modern training methods chess engines, online databases disproportionately favors nations with a lower average age compared to those relying on traditional experience.
